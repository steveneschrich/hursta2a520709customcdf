# hursta2a520709customcdf
This is an R package for encapsulating the chip definition file (CDF) from Affymetrix for a custom Affy array known as the HuRSTA chip. The chip definition is available in GEO as [Platform GPL10379](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL10379). This CDF represents a redefinition of the array based on commercial experience running many arrays. Note that there is an alternate CDF also available on GEO as [Platform GPL15048](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL15048) which was the original, designed CDF.

For this package, if you want to use it you can install it via devtools:

```r
devtools::install_github("steveneschrich/hursta2a520709customcdf")
```
